### My jquery-ui widget compendium

I will be adding jquery-ui widgets that I create while trying new stuff, some of them might not even be very useful for regular web pages. 
Who cares? :)

The code in this repository is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/jlreymendez/qui/blob/master/License.txt).

### Support
This widgets are only made for the fun of it. I only tend to test them on browsers that support html5 and css3, so don't expect too much legacy support.

If you need something to work on an older browser grab the code and mess with it all you like. Also, feel free to contact me although I can't promise a prompt reply.
